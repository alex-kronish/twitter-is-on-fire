# Twitter is burning.

I, a fool, spent alot of time retweeting images and never saving them.
This is a python script that will save all media you've ever posted/retweeted. Needs your twitter archive as an input. Look for tweets.js and remove the first line up to the character `[`

Then tell the script where the file is located, and a path where you wanna save it to. I wrote this on linux, so if you switch it to use windows, you should denote paths with two `\` characters like `C:\\Users\\Alex`

Goodluck, godspeed, and fuck Elongation Man
